## Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). 

First let's see what's in the database, the main repository of 
protein structures. 

Downloaded composition stats from: https://www.rcsb.orgs/stats/summary

For context: Release 2023_04 of 13-Sep-2023 of UnitProt/TrEMBL 
contains 251600,768 sequence entries. The PDB only contains 183,201. 



```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

```{r}
dim(stats)
```

There is a problem here due to commas in the numbers. This causes them to be treated 
as characters. 

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
x
```

```{r}
as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x) )
```

Making a function of how to do this. 


```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x))
}
```


```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

I can use the `apply()` function to fix this whole table. 

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
```

```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
totals
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron 
Microscopy.

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2 )
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbstats[1, "Total"]
```

```{r}
pdbstats[1, "Total"] / sum(pdbstats[, "Total"] * 100, 2)
```




```{r}
round((pdbstats[1, "Total"] / 251600768) *100, 2) 
```



> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just oneatom per water
molecule inthis structure?

This is a 2 Angstrom structure and hydrogen is not visible at this resolution. 1 
Angrstrom or better is needed. 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you 
identify this water molecule? 

Water 308 is the conserved water molecule in the binding site. 

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct  chains of HIV-protease
along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 
in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these 
side-chains). Add thisfigure to your Quarto document.

Here is a figure of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues,  the MK1 compound and all 
the important water 308.

The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions 
of a PDB structure. 


```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")

m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```
